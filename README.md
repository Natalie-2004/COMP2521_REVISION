# COMP2521 REVISION

## Data Structure
- Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heap, Tries

## Algorithm Analysis
- Times/Spacess Complexity

## Sorting
- Stable Sorting
  If elements being sorted have the same value, then the order of those elements in the unsorted list, is the same in the sorted list.

- Unstable/Adaptive Sorting
  Elements with the same value aren't necessarily kept in the same order after sorted

- Time Complexity Table
